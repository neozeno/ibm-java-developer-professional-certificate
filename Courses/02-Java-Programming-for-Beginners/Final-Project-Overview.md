## About the course project

In this project, you will apply the knowledge and skills learned in this course
to a simulated scenario. You will create a console application
for a grocery shop, which will calculate the total of grocery items chosen
depending on the unit price and quantity. The tasks in this hands-on project
correspond to the activities performed by a Java Developer who is creating
a stand-alone console application.

This final project, which will take about 30 minutes to complete,
is comprised of 14 tasks.

1. Task 1: String array of items
  Create a String array of items you will buy from a grocery shop. It should be a minimum of 10, but not more than 25.

Task 2: float array of unit price
Create a float array of unit price for items, which corresponds to the index positions in the items array. The float array should be the same length as the items array.

Task 3: Import and create a Scanner object
Import and create a scanner object and create an object of scanner object to read from the console.

Task 4: Create infinite loop
Create an infinite loop that runs as long as the user wants the loop to run. The loop should exit when the user inputs Exit (ignoring the case).

Task 5: Create for inner infinite loop for purchases
Create an infinite loop that runs as long as the user wants to add items. The loop should exit when the user inputs Complete (ignoring the case).

Task 6: Get user input for item name
Get input for item name from the user and check the array for the item. If the item is in the array, get the index of the item and store the item name.

Task 7: Get the item price based on the index position
Get the item price from the same index position in the array as the item.

Task 8: Get the item quantity and find item price
Calculate each item’s price and add the item prices to the total bill.

Task 9: Print the total price
When all required items are chosen, print the total bill price.

Task 10: Implement Item Search Functionality
Create a method to search for an item in the items array.

Task 11: Calculate Average Price
Create a method to calculate the average price of the items.

Task 12: Filter Items Below a Certain Price
Create a method to filter items below a specified price.

Task 13: Total the Bill with Discounts
Modify your program to apply discounts on total bill based on certain conditions.

Task 14: Inventory Management
Create an inventory management system for tracking available stock of items.
