# Case Study: Leave Tracking System

Throughout this case study, I learned how to use Java object-oriented
programming concepts to build a practical application that manages
employee leave requests.

## What is a Leave Tracking System?

A Leave Tracking System helps organizations manage employee time-off
requests that allows employees to:

- Submit leave requests
- Check leave balances
- View request status
- Cancel pending requests

Leave tracking systems allow managers to:

- Review leave requests
- Approve or deny leave requests
- Generate reports on team availability

## Why use this case study?

Leave tracking is an excellent example for learning object-oriented
programming because the leave system:

- Contains real-world objects (employees, leave requests, leave types)
- Demonstrates relationships between objects
- Involves data management and business rules
- Scales from simple to complex implementations

## Learning journey

As I progressed through each module, I gradually built different
components of the Leave Tracking System:

- Module 1: Create the basic classes for employees and leave requests
- Module 2: Expand the system with inheritance and polymorphism for different
  types of leave
- Module 3: Implement Java collections to store and manage multiple requests
- Module 4: Use file operations to save and load leave data
- Module 5: Implement date handling for leave periods and calculations
- Module 6: Complete the leave system with the creation of a functional
  application
