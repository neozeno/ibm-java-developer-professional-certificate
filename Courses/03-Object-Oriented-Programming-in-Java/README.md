# Object Oriented Programming in Java

## Overview

This the third course of the [IBM Java Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/java-developer)

In this module, I have become knowledgeable about the core principles of
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, including classes, objects,
encapsulation, and constructors. I explored advanced topics such as inheritance,
polymorphism, interfaces, and abstract classes. In hands-on labs, I created
classes, build constructors, implement polymorphism, and design interfaces
and abstract classes.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and describe basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and constructors.
- Explain the principles of inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces,
  and abstract classes in Java.
- Implement encapsulation, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism
  in my own Java programs.
- Differentiate between interfaces and abstract classes and their appropriate
  uses in OOP.
- Design and develop Java applications using advanced OOP principles including
  method overloading and inner classes.
- Assess the effectiveness of different OOP designs and implementations
  through quizzes and practical labs.
